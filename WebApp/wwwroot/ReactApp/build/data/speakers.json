Mark will teach you had to turn this \"Conventional Engineer's Wisdom\" on its head and build products that people will buy on day one. Many times, we engineers build features without ever talking to the customers and users who they benefit. We'll start with the absolute basics: how to define your customer and discover what their true problem is. \"But I don't have any customers or users!\" you will say. You will learn how and where to find them and then how to engage them in meaningful conversation about their problems. Our goal? Build the right solution for the right customer and make them ultimately beg you for your solution. Teaching with examples, Mark will share his specific experiences finding customers and how to talk to them. We'll run through several tools, tips and tricks Mark used to find success (after years of failing). This is a unique opportunity to learn nuggets of Lean Startup wisdom from one of the Bay Area's most enthusiastic trainers and mentors.",

          "description": "It has always been said that Android is not a complete platform.  The app developer must include several popular libraries as a base just to start to build a simple app.  Now Google has expressed the same sediment.  The four App components of Android (Activities, Services, Broadcast receivers and Content providers) are not the building blocks of an Android app but a contract between the OS and Application.  App developers need to rebuild the basic building blocks whenever starting a new App.   This causes many problems for developers and leads to ambiguity about how to best build a robust App. \n <br/><br/>\nGoogle is looking to remedy this problem by releasing the Android Architectural Components (Room, Lifecycle-aware components, ViewModels and LiveData).  While they individually address developer pain points (Persist Data, Manage Lifecycles, Modular & remove errors) they also work together to implement a sane app architecture. In this talk we will detail each components functions and benefits\n  <br/><br/>\nOnce we have a clear understanding of the Architectural Components we will explain how they work together to form a robust reference architecture. Common architectural principles: The most important thing you should focus on is the separation of concerns in your app.\n <br/><br/>\nThe second important principle is that you should drive your UI from a model, preferably a persistent model.\n  <br/><br/>\nWe end the talk by reviewing how these new components replace and interact with current popular Android libraries. <br/><br/>\n",

What if you could simply add a browser control to the app and hook it up to your code? \n <br/><br/>\nThis session shows an example of a C# .NET application, with an Angular UI running in a CefSharp (Chromium Embedded Framework for C#) browser control, and a minimal back end using ASP.NET WebAPI. There is no server. All the networking layers between the browser and the WebAPI are replaced with asynchronous callbacks. The Angular UI and the ASP.NET WebAPI are completely standard and can be tested separately from the rest of your app. So you get a well-structured application with a beautiful modern user interface and minimal overhead.

A standard mechanism by which services can easily scale up and down based upon metadata is important. The exact address of a service may not be known until the service is deployed and ready to be used. The dynamic nature of a service’s endpoint address is handled by service registration, discovery and a load balancer. This is all the more important in a containerized world where each container is like a cattle.Docker, Kubernetes, DC/OS and ECS are commonly used container orchestration platforms. They all have built-in support for service discovery and scalability. This talk will explain how this requirement of microservices are met in these orchestration frameworks. Specifically, configuration files for a Java application talking to a database will be shown for different frameworks.",

Typically, it was a team for which we worked harder - but from which we took away more exhilaration and joy - than any other team in our careers. What made it so? And what can we do to get it again?\n\nSuccessful software development cultures are ones that are not just performant but that also both delight customers and are a joy for every team member to be part of. \n\nOne of the characteristics that differentiates agile cultures is that (finally!) it’s not just managers who are responsible for crafting culture - but everyone. Every one of the various kinds of managers engaged with product and project teams have a role in crafting culture and supporting the emergence of high performance teams. But agile, done well, means every one of us engages in the crafting of it. \n\nUltimately, stellar team experiences derive from us. We need to truly trust and respect and engage and share - behaviors that can feel at odds with the fierce independence from whence we’ve come.\n\nHow can people who are often introverted, highly-logical, independent thinkers not only form teams but make those teams self-organizing and high-performance? What’s the role of leaders in crafting culture that supports emergence of high performance teams? What can we all do to be part of a high performance team once again? How do we make our dream teams come true?",

This requires understanding the inner dependencies between services and activities, the critical path of integration, the available floats, the staff distribution and the risks involved. All of these challenges stem from your design and addressing them properly is a hard core engineering task – designing the project. In this intense session Juval Lowy shares his approach software project design, along with his unique insight for delivering software on schedule and budget. You will also see to deal with common misconceptions and typical roles and responsibilities in the team.\n",

In this dense session Juval Lowy will explain his approach to large system analysis and design, using volatility to decompose a system into its comprising services. Juval will contrast it with the most common mistake done in architecture, using functionality to identify services. These are universal design principles, and Juval will use examples from software and non-software systems alike. You will also see how to overcome the real hurdles architects face pursuing volatility-based decomposing, simple and practical techniques for identifying areas of volatility, common telltale signs or \"smells\" when your design is still functional when using the Method, IDesign's approach for system architecture. You will see how to literally mechanize software system design, how to do it quickly and effectively. ",

Other companies are partial to behavioral questions, factual/knowledge questions, and big lofty architecture and design questions. \n\nWe’ll discuss the different styles of technical and behavioral interviews for software developers. What’s right for your company? And how do you help candidates do their very best (and why is this so important)? How to keep your standards reasonable, but high and consistent? How do you limit your false negatives and false positives? \n\nHiring managers and recruiters will learn how to create a better process. Interviewers will learn how to select and ask better questions. And candidates will get to explore what happens on the other side of the hiring table. \n\nThis session will cover behavioral questions, coding questions, algorithm questions, knowledge questions, design questions, and code assessment/test tools.",

Whether it is dealing with basic algorithms of Sorting, whether it's simple data-structures like Linked Lists, Arrays & Strings, or whether it's about traversing complex data-structures like Trees and Graphs, you're bound to come across Recursion-based solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Recursion can be a difficult concept to grasp for many of us, but it doesn't have to be. It's one of those things that can be reigned with practice, and once reigned, it gives dividends all through your practice.</p> \n\n<p>Once you're comfortable with recursion, then Dynamic Programming also becomes easier, because Recursion is the first logical step to solving many DP problems.

You will learn why the architecture that you pick for your application matters. And you will learn how to solve key challenges with decomposing an application into microservices.

The locations on the board are also place markers, and there are active NFC readers installed at the corners of the board. These readers may be active and may include battery power. The positions within the board may be calibrated with the readers so the instructional objects  may be identified via its NFC tag (passive or active)  based on a power estimation measurement and/or interpolation calculation between the plurality of readers. The number of NFC tag readers may be one, two, three, four, eight, etc., and may use any known algorithm to estimate the power of the NFC tag in the game piece so the exact position may be estimated based on the relative power strength as measured by the active readers (e.g., triangulation, time difference of arrival (TDOA), etc.).\nIdentification of instructional objects, as well as the relative “micro-location” of the objects are used to select/initiate instructional content  to teach the user about combinations (e.g., multiplication tables, chemical compounds, words, etc.). For example, if it is detected that the letters “A”, “R” and “T” are present on the board, the computer application associated with the NFC readable tags in the three letters may detect their presence and position.  Another example would include chemical elements that may be included to generate complex hydrocarbon compounds used to teach the user about chemistry.\n",

This presentation is about tuning Kafka pipelines for high-performance.\n<br/><br/>\nThis presenter will begin by introducing the basic concepts of Kafka including, producer, consumer, and the broker. Kafka pipelines will be discussed next and the role of Mirror-maker in creating global data pipelines that span multiple datacenters. The presenter will then discuss select configuration parameters and deployment topologies essential to achieve higher throughput and low latency across the pipeline. \n<br/><br/>\nIn the second part the presenter will discuss anecdotes based on the real-world experience in running Kafka at LinkedIn. Specifically, lessons learned in troubleshooting and optimizing a truly global data pipeline that replicates 100GB data under 25 minutes will be discussed. \n<br/><br/>\nNo prior knowledge of Kafka is necessary however familiarity with publish-subscribe, big data technologies, sharding/partitioning will come in handy.",

Initially used in Unix text processing utilities ed and grep, many programming languages now have built-in support for regular expressions, such as Perl, Ruby, AWK, and Tcl. Others support it via a standard library, such as .NET languages, Java, Python and C++. This talk assumes you dabbled with regular expressions before, and teaches you how to read, construct and use simple to complex regular expressions. At the end of the session you'll understand how to define a regex that validates an e-mail address: \\b\\w[\\w.%+-]?@[\\w.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}\\b",

          "description": "The only thing stopping software from being inclusive is the developers. Being inclusive is not a \"bonus if we have enough time\", but needs to be a core focus of a project from the earliest stage to the final product. \n<br/><br/>\nA large number of developers recognize this is an important issue, but don’t think they have the resources to do anything about it. If more developers did these things, they could increase their potential audience tremendously. This isn't about altruism, it's just good business practice. \n<br/><br/>\nTobiah Zarlez from Microsoft will share what he has learned through his work with developers, as well as his own development experience. Attendees will take away 9 simple ideas that developers should know about when creating their software to greatly increase the inclusivity their final products. They will learn that inclusivity can be cheap and easy to integrate as long as these concepts are kept in mind from the beginning. ",

Hopefully, we'll have an intellectually-stimulating discussion where everybody will learn something new and get a fresh perspective on how to make the most of their potential. \n",
